# NeuralNetwork

## NeuralNetwork

###### This is a basic implementation of a multi-layer neural network.
###### To run, initialize the network and train it with trainNetwork.

## ReinforcementLearning

###### This is a simulation of a reward based anti-Hebbian learning rule.
###### To run, initialize and simulate with simulate.
###### Plot the false-positives of the network with plot.

## HopfieldNetwork

###### This is an implementation of a hopfield network that stores and recalls basic patterns.
###### To run, initialize the network and train using trainPattern.
###### Print out the organized learning pattern with correctMatrix.

## ImageReconstruction

###### This is a very basic implementation of a deep learning network that uses principle compenent analysis to reconstruct images.
###### This code is in matlab; simply run the code with an image in the path and properly labelled.
